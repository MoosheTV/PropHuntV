A standalone PropHunt gamemode for FiveM.

This gametype was made as part of a submission into the [FiveM Gametype Contest](https://forum.fivem.net/t/fivem-gametype-contest-prizes/176808).

### Live Demo

Directly Connect to the PropHuntV Official Server: **prophunt.mooshe.tv:30120**

### How to Set-up

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/MoosheTV/PropHuntV/releases/)
2. Unpack the zip file
3. Drag and drop the "prophunt" folder into your resources directory
4. Add `start prophunt` to your **server.cfg** file

That's all it takes! Very simple, straight-forward, and doesn't require anything else to be installed.
